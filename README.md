# NARM

This repo contains the Matlab implementation of the Node Attribute Relational Model (NARM) in the following paper:

He Zhao, Lan Du, and Wray Buntine, â€œLeveraging Node Attributes for Incomplete Relational Data," accepted in ICML 2017. 

The datasets are obtained from the original sources and pre-processed into Matlab format.

The code runs with Matlab 2016b (or later).

To run the demo of SymNARM, please go to the directory "SymNARM" and download the [EPM](https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/EPM) code of Mingyuan Zhou. Then run "demo_SymNARM.m".

To run the demo of AsymNARM, please go to the directory "AsymNARM" and run "demo_AsymNARM.m".
For AsymNARM, some functions are from the [code](http://people.duke.edu/~ch237/Softwares/hiercode.zip) of Changwei Hu.
